  - By extension, all resource reload issues with other mods (e.x. Frostiful and Guarding) should be fixed as well
- Resource reload fixes were developed with help from cortex, XFactHD, Pepper and others.

## [1.4.0] - 2024-08-31

### Added

- Added a warning that shows when Fog updates and the new update modifies some of the default biome colours - it will recommend you to backup any changes within the `.minecraft/config/fog/fog_definitions` folder and then delete it so the default biome colours can be reset and updated. We will look into a diff-like system for this at a later date.

### Changed

- Updated biome colours for: swamp biomes, jungle biomes, badlands/mesa biomes, sandy biomes (desert/beach), the end biomes and icy aquatic biomes. They should be much less bright and more consistent with the default vanilla biome colours now.
- Required YACL 3.5.0, Architectury API and MRU.

### Fixed

- Fixed various issues with underground fog, there will be less of a flicker when coming out of caves, and the underground multiplier will no longer rarely kick in when you enter buildings.
- Fixed issue where fog goes black when it's raining.
- Potentially fix some crash issues on 1.20.1 forge with YACL 3.5.0 - let us know if you're still encountering crashes here.

## [1.3.1] - 2024-08-15

### Changed

- Updated the required MRU version to 1.0.0.
- Moved shared functionality, including external resource pack handling, into MRU for reuse by other mods.

## [1.3.0] - 2024-08-14

### Added

- Added support for 1.21.1.
- Added new point-based calculations to detect if a player is underground. This should fix issues where being inside a building tricks Fog into thinking you're underground.

### Changed

- The default day and night colours have been changed, night is now much darker and closer resembles the vanilla night fog colours. Vice versa for the day colours.
- The colours for the `#c:is_swamp` fog definition have been modified to account for these new default colours. Delete the `.minecraft/config/fog/fog_definitions/assets/c/fog_definitions/tag/biome/is_swamp.json` file to get the updated file.
- When in caves, the fog start will be much closer, fixing issues where there is a "pane" of colour blocking the view. It also massively improves cave fog in general.

### Removed

- Removed "Haze" system in favour of a single blend between day and night colours.

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where resource packs could not override Fog's default definitions due to the fact that Fog's resource pack was being loaded at the top regardless of the ordering on the Select Resource Pack screen.
